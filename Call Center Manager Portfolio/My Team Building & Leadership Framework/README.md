## My Team Building & Leadership Framework

Thank you for taking the time to look at examples of my Team Building & Leadership Framework. While it does not depict the entire process, it does illustrate my desire to innovate and push outside the box compared to my peers, and demonstrates the foundational steps I take in building successful teams.

### Team Picione Planning Session

My management style includes a carefully chosen blend of formal and informal communication. At Verizon Wireless we were given a new team of employees to work with about once every six months, this document is an example of a formal agenda created for a planning session with a new team. Verizon typically only performed planning sessions at higher levels of leadership, I pioneered using this strategy with our customer service teams. It was very successful at quickly progressing teams through the group development stages of forming and storming to norming and performing, and was adopted by many of my peers.

### Team Picione Mission Statement

This formal summary of team goals was different for each team I led. Forged during our planning session, our mission statement was a reflection of the identity we collectively wanted to portray; and a commitment to our customers, leadership, and ourselves. It was signed by all members of the team, displayed on all of our desks, used during coaching sessions and team meetings to gauge our success, and handed to the Director of our call center to document our pledge to excellence. While a mission statement is not a ground breaking business practice, it was the first time an individual team had done this at Verizon, and was another impactful best practice my teams employed that other leaders chose to emulate due to its overall success in quickly creating positive, performing cultures on new teams.

### Team Picione Performance Showcase

The Performance Showcase is a best practice I designed to improve representative performance, accountability, confidence, leadership skills, communication skills, and give them a platform to build their personal brand with call center leadership. Modeled after an operations review, each member of the team spoke about their performance, their successes, and their commitment to personal growth. The process of developing their slide and practicing their presentation was completed as a group and promoted unparalleled maturation as a team; additionally, the leadership and communication experience gained was an indespensible step in their career progression. This is another visionary exercise implented by other leaders in the call center.

### The Achieve System

Many of the ideas I have enacted in my Team Building Framework originate from the training I received from the Achieve Institute. Concepts that resonated with me such as "best actual", "create don't fix", "expand your capacity", "Point B", and creating a "new normal" have become integral parts of my Team Building and Leadership Frameworks. I would relish the opportunity to speak more regarding these topics; however, it is copyrighted material. Please do not hesitate to ask me about them in an interview.

## Leading at the Speed of Trust

In my experience, trust is at the core of all success and must be present on a productive team no matter what the cost. In addition to 20 years experience cultivating confidence in and from my teams, I have completed the Franklin Covey Training Solution, "Leading at the Speed of Trust", and implement its core concepts into my everyday leadership strategy. This material is also copyrighted, I welcome a candid discussion about them when we meet.

### An Attitude of Gratitude

While I do not have documentation to share regarding this plank of my Team Building Framework, I believe it is critically important to share. Promoting gratitude in daily huddles, weekly meetings, and impromptu interactions on the call center floor is an indispensable component of building teams that helps them focus on what they can control, focus on what is possible, and understand that being happy and positive is a conscious choice one can make and infectious in the workplace. This is achieved through a consistent message and mastery of your emotional intelligence.

The necessity of gratitude in my life and its significance to team prosperity was instilled in me thanks to a training authored and facilitated by Mark Hiltz, Vice President of Internal Sales and Service at Nationwide Insurance. It is my sincerest hope that his aspiration of speaking and teaching the attitude of gratitude comes to fruition; until then, you can follow his posts regarding gratitude on LinkedIn:

### Team Building through Volunteer Work

Typical team building activities sponsored by most organizations involve forced participation, controlled environments, and simulated events intended to build familiarity and trust among coworkers. I believe team building is most effective when participation is voluntary and not simulated or completely controlled, leaving unique challenges with real consequences and infinite possibility.

In 2017 I asked my team to brainstorm options for a team building event. They elected to organize and facilitate a prepared meal for several hundred patients and their families at our local Ronald McDonald House. They were in charge of every aspect of planning, fulfillment, and execution; I documented their progress, participated as an equal member of the team where directed, and provided guidance when requested or necessary.

Conveying unwavering trust in my team and their potential, allowing them to partner to solve authentic and demanding problems, then celebrating their successes unquestionably established the most meaningful and lasting associations I have witnessed in a business setting. The existance of a bona fide common interest, which is not present in typical team builders, created a veritable camaraderie that simply cannot be matched through any other means.
