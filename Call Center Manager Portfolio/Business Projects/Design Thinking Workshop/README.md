# Design Thinking (UX) Workshop

In this 2 day project we implemented design thinking (UX), or 'Outside the Box' thinking, to understand the user, challenge assumptions, and redefine the problem to inspire creative solutions that would not be immediately apparent at first glance.

The process was customer centric and solutions based; it was intended to quickly produce prototypes, get customer feedback, and fail quickly in order to overcome obstacles and succeed sooner. While the steps below were taken in order, they do not have to be. They can occur concurrently, and repeatedly. 

In this workshop our goal was to redesign a self-serve prepaid wireless phone kiosk placed in big box retail locations. We were given the opportunity to visit real locations as well as work with real customers for interviews, prototype testing, and feedback. Out of four teams our prototype was rated the highest by customers.

## Discover

Look at a problem or opportunity in a fresh way, notice new things, and gather insights.

### Divergence & Convergence Cycle

At the beginning of the workshop we were given a high level overview of the Divergence and Convergence Cycle before jumping into EDIPT (Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test). In short, there are four phases:

1. Discover insight into the problem (ideas created, diamond size increases)
2. Define the area to focus on (narrow down to best ideas, diamond size decreases)
3. Develop potential solutions (solutions created, diamond size increases again)
4. Delivery solutions that work (narrow down to best solution, diamond size decreases again)

### Business Model Canvas

We used the Business Model Canvas as a guide to creating a new lean business model highlighting the most important aspects such as value proposition, customers, and finances. We used the form below; I am no longer in posession of the original handwritten document used in the workshop.

## Empathize

Work to understand the customer experience (CX) through observation, interaction, and immersion.

### Observational Research

To gain a true understanding of the customer experience (CX) you need first hand experience and knowledge of the location. This is achieved through Go to Gemba, focusing on Go See, Ask Why, and Show Respect.

#### Go to Gemba

Japanese for "the actual place", Go to Gemba is a Lean principle made famous by the words of Toyota Chairman Fujio Cho, "Go see, ask why, show respect". We observed customer interactions with the pay as you go wireless kiosk as well as their other surroundings, employees, and other customers.

When visiting a location we considered several factors regarding "Go see":

1. What is the purpose of this location? Of the broader organization? Are they aligned?
2. Are the processes displayed supporting that purpose?
3. Are the people at this location working to achieve that purpose?

We also worked to view the location through the following "Ask Why" lenses:

1. Solutions View; look for solutions
2. Waste View; look for waste
3. Problem View; look for problems

Regarding "Show Respect" we not only ensured we were respectful to those around us, we also looked for signs of disrespect by others towards:

1. Workers
2. Customers
3. The Organization

### Humanize the Target

To gain a true understanding of the customer experience (CX) you need first hand experience and knkowledge regarding the users. This is achieved through Interviews that focus on Persona, and A Day in the Life Of the user.

#### Interviews

The next part of understanding the customer experience (CX) was performing Interviews to gain an understanding of and help empathize with our target users.

During interviews we focused on understanding several key factors, asking follow up questions if necessary to better understand and empathize with them:

* Ask why; even if you think you know the answer
* Ask for specifics; "tell me about..."
* Look for inconsistencies; sometimes what people say and do are different, ask for clarification
* Pay attention to non-verbal queues; the majority of what is communicated is not what we say

We also followed a few best practices to increase the effectiveness of the interview:

* Interview in pairs; perception is frequently different based on worldview
* No Time Limit; feedback should go on as long as necessary
* Allow silence; this gives people time to reflect
* Avoid Yes/No questions; encourage conversation
* Encourage Story Telling; gain a better understanding of how they view the world
* Ask questions neutrally; avoid leading them to answers

#### Persona

1. What is their name and age?
2. In what city or down do they live?
3. Are they married, have children, or have their parents living with them?
4. What industry do they work in? Job title?
5. How many phones do they have? Details - smartphones? basic phones? landlines? etc.
6. What forms of communication do they use? - phone? text? landline? snap chat? FaceTime? Skype? etc.
7. How do they keep track of news and current events?
8. How often do they read books or magazines? How do they access that material? 
9. How often do they watch movies? How do they access that material?

#### A Day In The Life Of

1. When do they get up?
2. What is their first interface of the day?
3. How many devices do they interface with prior to leaving for work?
4. How do they commute? Do they interface with any devices while commuting?
5. Do they have any need for personal interface while at work?
6. Is anyone at home while they are at work?
7. What devices do people at home interface with during the day?
8. What do they do after work?
9. How do they spend their evening?
10. How and what content did they watch?
11. What time do they go to bed?

### Understand the Customer Experience

The final step of Empathize that helps to ensure we have a full picture of the customer experience (CX) is Journey Mapping.

#### Journey Map

Using a visual representation of the customer's journey creates a narrative we can follow which uncovers additional perspectives, factors, or problems we have not yet anticipated.

#### Empathize Best Practices Not Utilized in Workshop:

1. Ethnographic Study
2. Empathy Map
3. Conjoint Analysis
4. Kano Analysis
5. Customer Segmentation

## Define

In the Define step of EDIPT we take the research done and use a few tools to make sense of the data. We determine all the possibilities; determine which are feasible, which matter the most, and which should be acted upon.

## Prototype

Transform these ideas into a physical form then interact with them; empathize with the customer and their experience with the solution.

In our brief 2 day workshop we did not have the opportunity to create real prototypes. Instead, we drew them out on paper, created a presentation, and were given the opportunity to meet with real customers to paint a picture for them of what the experience with the new kiosk would be like. Here are my handwritten notes regarding the prototype:

2. Sketch
3. Physical Prototype

6. Role Play
7. Failure Mode Effect Analysis

## Test

Try it, observe interactions, use feedback to learn more about the customer, refine the prototype and continue to iterate and improve, if necessary.

### Customer Feedback

We used a customer feedback grid that focused on a few basic questions:

1. What worked?
2. What could be improved?
3. What questions do you have?
4. What ideas do you have?

Similar to our research early in the project while interviewing, we focused on understanding several key factors, asking follow up questions if necessary to better understand and empathize with them:

* Ask why; even if you think you know the answer
* Ask for specifics; "tell me about..."
* Look for inconsistencies; sometimes what people say and do are different, ask for clarification
* Pay attention to non-verbal queues; the majority of what is communicated is not what we say

We also followed a few best practices to increase the effectiveness of the interview:

* Interview in pairs; perception is frequently different based on worldview
* No Time Limit; feedback should go on as long as necessary
* Allow silence; this gives people time to reflect
* Avoid Yes/No questions; encourage conversation
* Encourage Story Telling; gain a better understanding of how they view the world
* Ask questions neutrally; avoid leading them to answers

#### Test Best Practices Not Utilized in Workshop:

1. Feedback Surveys
2. Focus Groups
3. Usability Testing

## Delivery

Resulting project is finalized, produced, and launched. 

After all four groups in our workshop had completed testing and received feedback we met as a group, discussed what worked and what didn't from each project, and all four were taken by the workshop leader to be considered in the real development of a new solution for pre-paid kiosks in big box retail locations. While we did not receive further communication, I am confident that the work we did proved useful in their Design Thinking process.
