## Design Thinking (UX) Workshop

In this 2 day project we implemented design thinking (UX), or 'Outside the Box' thinking, to understand the user, challenge assumptions, and redefine the problem to inspire creative solutions that would not be immediately apparent.

The process was customer centric and solutions based; it was intended to quickly produce prototypes, get customer feedback, and fail quickly in order to overcome obstacles and succeed sooner. While the steps below were taken order, they do not have to be. They can occur concurrently, and repeatedly. 

In this workshop our goal was to redesign a self-serve prepaid wireless phone kiosk placed in big box retail locations. We were given the opportunity to visit real locations; and, work with real customers for interviews, prototype testing, and feedback. Out of four teams our prototype was rated the highest by customers.

### Discover

Look in a fresh way, notice new things, and gather insights.

#### Divergence & Convergence Cycle

At the beginning of the workshop we were given a high level overview of the Divergence and Convergence Cycle before jumping into EDIPT (Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test). In short, there are four phases:

1. Discover insight into the problem (ideas created, diamond size increases)
2. Define the area to focus on (narrow down to best ideas, diamond size decreases)
3. Develop potential solutions (solutions created, diamond size increases again)
4. Delivery solutions that work (narrow down to best solution, diamond size decreases again)

#### Business Model Canvas

We used the Business Model Canvas as a guide to creating a new lean business model highlighting the most important aspects such as value proposition, customers, and finances.

### Empathize

Work to understand the customer experience (CX) through observation, interaction, and immersion.

#### Observational Research

Go to Gemba

#### Humanize the Target

Interviews

The next part of understanding the customer experience (CX) was performing Interviews to gain an understanding of and help empathize with our target users.

During interviews we focused on understanding several key factors, asking follow up questions if necessary to better understand and empathize with them:

* Ask why; even if you think you know the answer
* Ask for specifics; "tell me about..."
* Look for inconsistencies; sometimes what people say and do are different, ask for clarification
* Pay attention to non-verbal queues; the majority of what is communicated is not what we say

We also followed a few best practices to increase the effectiveness of the interview:

* Interview in pairs; perception is frequently different based on worldview
* No Time Limit; feedback should go on as long as necessary
* Allow silence; this gives people time to reflect
* Avoid Yes/No questions; encourage conversation
* Encourage Story Telling; gain a better understanding of how they view the world
* Ask questions neutrally; avoid leading them to answers

Persona

1. What is their name and age?
2. In what city or down do they live?
3. Are they married, have children, or have their parents living with them?
4. What industry do they work in? Job title?
5. How many phones do they have? Details - smartphones? basic phones? landlines? etc.
6. What forms of communication do they use? - phone? text? landline? snap chat? FaceTime? Skype? etc.
7. How do they keep track of news and current events?
8. How often do they read books or magazines? How do they access that material? 
9. How often do they watch movies? How do they access that material?

A day in the life of

1. When do they get up?
2. What is their first interface of the day?
3. How many devices do they interface with prior to leaving for work?
4. How do they commute? Do they interface with any devices while commuting?
5. Do they have any need for personal interface while at work?
6. Is anyone at home while they are at work?
7. What devices do people at home interface with during the day?
8. What do they do after work?
9. How do they spend their evening?
10. How and what content did they watch?
11. What time do they go to bed?

#### Understand the Customer Experience

Journey map

### Define

Make sense of all the possibilities; determine which are feasible, which matter the most, and which should be acted upon. 

#### Understand Customer Needs & Motivation
#### Capture Additional Insights
#### Convert Needs to Requirements

### Ideate

Explore a large, diverse list of possible solutions which empowers you to create new, unique ideas instead of simply fixing old ones.

#### Brainstorm Solutions
#### Uncover Other Areas to Explore

### Prototype

Transform these ideas into a physical form then interact with them; empathize with the customer and their experience with the solution.

In our brief 2 day workshop we did not have the opportunity to create real prototypes. Instead, we drew them out on paper, created a presentation, and were given the opportunity to meet with real customers to paint a picture for them of what the experience with the new kiosk would be like.

View my [handwritten notes](https://pdf.url) on the prototype, and some of the talking points for the presentation.

### Test

Try it, observe interactions, use feedback to learn more about the customer, refine the prototype and continue to iterate and improve, if necessary.

As mentioned above, our testing was limited to a presentation given to real customers. View my [handwritten notes](https://pdf.url) on the prototype, and some of the talking points for the presentation.

#### Customer Feedback

We used a customer feedback grid that focused on a few basic questions:

1. What worked?
2. What could be improved?
3. What questions do you have?
4. What ideas do you have?

Similar to our research early in the project while interviewing, we focused on understanding several key factors, asking follow up questions if necessary to better understand and empathize with them:

* Ask why; even if you think you know the answer
* Ask for specifics; "tell me about..."
* Look for inconsistencies; sometimes what people say and do are different, ask for clarification
* Pay attention to non-verbal queues; the majority of what is communicated is not what we say

We also followed a few best practices to increase the effectiveness of the interview:

* Interview in pairs; perception is frequently different based on worldview
* No Time Limit; feedback should go on as long as necessary
* Allow silence; this gives people time to reflect
* Avoid Yes/No questions; encourage conversation
* Encourage Story Telling; gain a better understanding of how they view the world
* Ask questions neutrally; avoid leading them to answers

### Delivery

Resulting project is finalized, produced, and launched. 

After all four groups in our workshop had completed testing and received feedback we met as a group, discussed what worked and what didn't from each project, and all four were taken by the workshop leader to be considered in the real development of a new solution for pre-paid kiosks in big box retail locations. While we did not receive further communication, I am confident that the work we did proved useful in the
