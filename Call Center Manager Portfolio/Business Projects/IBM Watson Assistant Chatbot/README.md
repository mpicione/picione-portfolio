## Project Goal

Obtain functional knowledge of IBM Watson Assistant and demonstrate proficiency by creating demo chatbot.

## Project Result

Also uncovered and used several features such as the ability to present users with options to make navigation easier, alter the chat user interface appearance, and how to embed it into a webpage.
